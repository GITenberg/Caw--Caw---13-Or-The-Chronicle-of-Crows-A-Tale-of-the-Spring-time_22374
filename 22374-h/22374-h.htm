When the sun shines bright and the days grow long,<br />
And the crocuses brilliant, in purple and gold,<br />
Bloom in the gardens in numbers untold;<br />
When in the fields the grass grows green,<br />
And a few early lambs are seen;<br />
When daffodils in gaudy gowns<br />
Look gay upon the verdant downs,<br />
And fair spring flowers of each degree<br />
In every sheltered nook you see.</p>

Mamma and Nurse went out one day,<br />
And left her all alone at play;<br />
Now, on the table close at hand,<br />
A box of matches chanc&rsquo;d to stand;<br />
And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,<br />
That if she touch&rsquo;d them, they should scold her.<br />
But Harriet said, &ldquo;Oh, what a pity!<br />
For, when they burn, it is so pretty;<br />
They crackle so, and spit, and flame;<br />
Mamma, too, often does the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse20_2">The pussy-cats heard this,<br />
And they began to hiss,<br />
And stretch their claws,<br />
And raise their paws;<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;me-ow, me-o<br />
You&rsquo;ll burn to death, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="verse20_3">But Harriet would not take advice,<br />
She lit a match, it was so nice!<br />
It crackled so, it burn&rsquo;d so clear,&mdash;<br />
Exactly like the picture here.<br />
She jump&rsquo;d for joy and ran about,<br />
And was too pleas&rsquo;d to put it out.</p>

<p class="verse20_4">The pussy-cats saw this,<br />
And said, &ldquo;Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!&rdquo;<br />
And stretch&rsquo;d their claws,<br />
And rais&rsquo;d their paws;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very, very wrong, you know,<br />
Me-ow, Me-o, Me-ow, Me-o,<br />
You will be burnt, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

What else, poor pussies, could they do?<br />
They scream&rsquo;d for help, &rsquo;twas all in vain!<br />
So then, they said,&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll scream again;<br />
Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o<br />
She&rsquo;ll burn to death,&mdash;we told her so&rdquo;.</p>

Among her ashes on the ground.</p>

The smoking ashes, how they cried!<br />

I must go out and leave you here.<br />
But mind now, Conrad, what I say,<br />
Don&rsquo;t suck your thumb while I&rsquo;m away.<br />
The great tall tailor always comes<br />
To little boys that suck their thumbs;<br />
And ere they dream what he&rsquo;s about,<br />
He takes his great sharp scissars out<br />
And cuts their thumbs clean off,&mdash;and then,<br />
You know, they never grow again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse29_2">Mamma had scarcely turn&rsquo;d her back,<br />
The thumb was in, Alack! Alack!</p>

The plump and hearty healthy boy.<br />
He ate and drank as he was told,<br />
And never let his soup get cold.<br />
But one day, one cold winter&rsquo;s day!<br />
He scream&rsquo;d out&mdash;&ldquo;Take the soup away!<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_2">Next day, now look, the picture shows<br />
How lank and lean Augustus grows!<br />
Yet, though he feels so weak and ill,<br />
The naughty fellow cries out still&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_3">The third day comes; Oh what a sin!<br />
To make himself so pale and thin.<br />
Yet, when the soup is put on table,<br />
He screams, as loud as he is able,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_4">Look at him, now the fourth day&rsquo;s come<br />
He scarcely weighs a sugar-plum;<br />
He&rsquo;s like a little bit of thread;<br />
And on the fifth day, he was&mdash;dead!</p>

Going in and coming out;<br />
This was all he thought about.<br />
So he strode on, only think!<br />
To the river&rsquo;s very brink,<br />

And the water very deep;<br />
And the fishes, in a row,<br />
Stared to see him coming so.</p>

Hook&rsquo;d poor Johnny out again.</p>

<p class="verse37_2">Oh! you should have seen him shiver<br />
When they pull&rsquo;d him from the river.<br />
He was in a sorry plight,<br />

Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair:<br />
Johnny never will forget<br />
What it is to be so wet.</p>

Are come back again, you see;<br />
Up they came the moment after,<br />
To enjoy the fun and laughter.<br />

Bob was in it.<br />
Here you see him, silly fellow,<br />
Underneath his red umbrella.</p>

<p class="verse38_2">What a wind! Oh! how it whistles<br />
Through the trees and flow&rsquo;rs and thistles!<br />
It has caught his red umbrella;<br />
Now look at him, silly fellow,<br />
Up he flies<br />
To the skies.<br />
No one heard his screams and cries;<br />
Through the clouds the rude wind bore him,<br />
And his hat flew on before him.</p>

<p class="verse38_3">Soon they got to such a height,<br />
They were nearly out of sight!<br />
And the hat went up so high,<br />
That it really touch&rsquo;d the sky.<br />
No one ever yet could tell<br />
Where they stopp&rsquo;d, or where they fell:<br />
Only, this one thing is plain,<br />
Bob was never seen again!</p>

<h3><a name="verse17" id="verse17"></a>2. THE STORY OF CRUEL FREDERICK.</h3>

<p class="i">Here is cruel Frederick, see!<br />
A horrid wicked boy was he;<br />
He caught the flies, poor little things,<br />
And then tore off their tiny wings;<br />
He kill&rsquo;d the birds, and broke the chairs,<br />
And threw the kitten down the stairs;<br />
And Oh! far worse than all beside,<br />
He whipp&rsquo;d his Mary, till she cried.</p>

<p class="i"><a name="verse18" id="verse18"></a>The trough was full, and faithful Tray<br />
Came out to drink one sultry day;<br />
He wagg&rsquo;d his tail, and wet his lip,<br />
When cruel Fred snatch&rsquo;d up a whip,<br />
And whipp&rsquo;d poor Tray till he was sore,<br />
And kick&rsquo;d and whipp&rsquo;d him more and more;<br />
At this, good Tray grew very red,<br />
And growl&rsquo;d and bit him till he bled;<br />
Then you should only have been by,<br />
To see how Fred did stream and cry!</p>
<p class="i link3"><a href="#verse18a">Return to page</a></p>


<p class="i"><a name="verse19" id="verse19"></a>So Frederick had to go to bed;<br />
His leg was very sore and red!<br />
The Doctor came and shook his head,<br />
And made a very great to-do,<br />
And gave him nasty physic too.</p>

<p class="i">But good dog Tray is happy now;<br />
He has no time to say &ldquo;bow-wow!&rdquo;<br />
He seats himself in Frederick&rsquo;s chair,<br />
And laughs to see the nice things there:<br />
The soup he swallows, sup by sup,&mdash;<br />
And eats the pies and puddings up.</p>

<h3><a name="verse20" id="verse20"></a>3. THE DREADFUL STORY ABOUT HARRIET AND THE MATCHES.</h3>

<p class="i">It almost makes me cry to tell<br />
What foolish Harriet befell.<br />
Mamma and Nurse went out one day,<br />
And left her all alone at play;<br />
Now, on the table close at hand,<br />
A box of matches chanc&rsquo;d to stand;<br />
And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,<br />
That if she touch&rsquo;d them, they should scold her.<br />
But Harriet said, &ldquo;Oh, what a pity!<br />
For, when they burn, it is so pretty;<br />
They crackle so, and spit, and flame;<br />
Mamma, too, often does the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="i">The pussy-cats heard this,<br />
And they began to hiss,<br />
And stretch their claws,<br />
And raise their paws;<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;me-ow, me-o<br />
You&rsquo;ll burn to death, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="i">But Harriet would not take advice,<br />
She lit a match, it was so nice!<br />
It crackled so, it burn&rsquo;d so clear,&mdash;<br />
Exactly like the picture here.<br />
She jump&rsquo;d for joy and ran about,<br />
And was too pleas&rsquo;d to put it out.</p>

<p class="i">The pussy-cats saw this,<br />
And said, &ldquo;Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!&rdquo;<br />
And stretch&rsquo;d their claws,<br />
And rais&rsquo;d their paws;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very, very wrong, you know,<br />
Me-ow, Me-o, Me-ow, Me-o,<br />
You will be burnt, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="i link3"><a href="#verse20a">Return to page</a></p>


<p class="i"><a name="verse21" id="verse21"></a>And see! Oh! what a dreadful thing!<br />
The fire has caught her apron-string;<br />
Her apron burns, her arms, her hair;<br />
She burns all over, every where.</p>

<p class="i">Then how the pussy-cats did mew,<br />
What else, poor pussies, could they do?<br />
They scream&rsquo;d for help, &rsquo;twas all in vain!<br />
So then, they said,&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll scream again;<br />
Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o<br />
She&rsquo;ll burn to death,&mdash;we told her so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="i">So she was burnt, with all her clothes,<br />
And arms, and hands, and eyes and nose;<br />
Till she had nothing more to lose<br />
Except her little scarlet shoes;<br />
And nothing else but these was found<br />
Among her ashes on the ground.</p>

<p class="i">And when the good cats sat beside<br />
The smoking ashes, how they cried!<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo<br />
What will Mamma and Nursy do?&rdquo;<br />
Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast,<br />
They made a little pond at last.</p>

<h3><a name="verse22" id="verse22"></a>4. THE STORY OF THE INKY BOYS.</h3>

<p class="i">As he had often done before,<br />
The woolly-headed black-a-moor<br />
One nice fine summer&rsquo;s day went out<br />
To see the shops and walk about;<br />
And as he found it hot, poor fellow,<br />
He took with him his green umbrella.<br />
Then Edward, little noisy wag,<br />
Ran out and laugh&rsquo;d, and wav&rsquo;d his flag;<br />
And William came in jacket trim,<br />
And brought his wooden hoop with him;<br />
And Arthur, too, snatch&rsquo;d up his toys<br />
And join&rsquo;d the other naughty boys;<br />
So, one and all set up a roar<br />
And laugh&rsquo;d and hooted more and more,<br />
And kept on singing,&mdash;only think!&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Oh! Blacky, you&rsquo;re as black as ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i link3"><a href="#verse22a">Return to page</a></p>



<p class="i"><a name="verse23" id="verse23"></a>Now tall Agrippa lived close by,&mdash;<br />
So tall, he almost touch&rsquo;d the sky;<br />
He had a mighty inkstand too,<br />
In which a great goose-feather grew;<br />
He call&rsquo;d out in an angry tone,<br />
&ldquo;Boys, leave the black-a-moor alone!<br />
For if he tries with all his might,<br />
He cannot change from black to white.&rdquo;<br />
But ah! they did not mind a bit<br />
What great Agrippa said of it;<br />
But went on laughing, as before,<br />
And hooting at the black-a-moor.</p>

<p class="i"><a name="verse24" id="verse24"></a>Then great Agrippa foams with rage,<br />
Look at him on this very page!<br />
He seizes Arthur, seizes Ned,<br />
Takes William by his little head;<br />
And they may scream and kick, and call,<br />
Into the ink he dips them all;<br />
Into the inkstand, one, two, three,<br />
Till they are black, as black can be;<br />
Turn over now and you shall see.</p>

They have been made as black as crows,<br />
Quite black all over, eyes and nose,<br />
And legs, and arms, and heads, and toes,<br />
And trowsers, pinafores, and toys,&mdash;<br />
The silly little inky boys!<br />
Because they set up such a roar,<br />
And teas&rsquo;d the harmless black-a-moor.</p>

He&rsquo;s going out to have some fun.</p>

<p class="i">He finds it hard, without a pair<br />
Of spectacles, to shoot the hare:<br /></p>

<p class="i">The hare sits snug in leaves and grass,<br />
And laughs to see the green man pass.</p>

<p class="i">Now, as the sun grew very hot,<br />
And he a heavy gun had got,<br />
He lay down underneath a tree<br />
And went to sleep, as you may see.<br />
And, while he slept like any top,<br />
The little hare came, hop, hop, hop,&mdash;<br />
Took gun and spectacles, and then<br />
On her hind legs went off again.</p>

<p class="i">The poor man&rsquo;s wife was drinking up<br />
Her coffee in her coffee-cup;<br />
The gun shot cup and saucer through<br />

There liv&rsquo;d close by the cottage there<br />
The hare&rsquo;s own child, the little hare;<br />
And while she stood upon her toes,<br />
The coffee fell and burn&rsquo;d her nose,<br />

To little boys that suck their thumbs;<br />

Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had;<br />

The plump and hearty healthy boy.<br />
He ate and drank as he was told,<br />

But one day, one cold winter&rsquo;s day!<br />
He scream&rsquo;d out&mdash;&ldquo;Take the soup away!<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
